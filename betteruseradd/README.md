# bash-scripts

This repository contains bash scripts for various functions.

3-27-2016: Added simple useradd script, without conditional logic/input value checks. Use at your own risk.

3-28-2016: Added some conditional logic/checks for superuser before command execution.
	Still need to add input value checks.
	Wishlist: group additions.
