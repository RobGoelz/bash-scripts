# bash-scripts

This directory contains a script to more easily add a user to a system, including setting the user password.

3-27-2016: Added simple useradd script, without conditional logic/input value checks. Use at your own risk.

3-28-2016: Added some conditional logic/checks for superuser before command execution.
	Still need to add input value checks.
	Wishlist: group additions.
